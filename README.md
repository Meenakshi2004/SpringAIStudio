This is line two

This is line one

This is line two

You can also make your text **bold** or *italicize* it 

> Add a blockquote  
> Add multiple blockquotes

## Lists

1. Or make a list
2. You can either have an ordered list
    1. And add nested items

- Or an unordered list
    - And of course you add nested items here too

## Formatting Code
```
print("Wrapping text in three backticks is a great way to add a code block!")
print("You can add multiple lines of code")
```

```python
print("Specifiying the language = syntax highlighting!")
```

And of course you can always `print("Add inline code with single backticks")`
